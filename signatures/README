The signature database is in signatures.txt. 

Syntax: The syntax is one XML element per signature. To parse as
well-formed XML, this file would just need a document root element
(SigFile.pm actually adds it).

Meaning: The signature format is a bare-bones result of k-Means
clustering.  See generate-signature.pl for how a signature is
generated and the expected format of an input file. See SigFile.pm for
the format of the signatures DB file.

Each signature record contains a descriptive name, then a list of
clusters and their respective sizes. Both cluster coordinates and
cluster sizes must be treated as relative by any classifier and
distribution distance, because their absolute values ultimately come
for the traffic captures used for training (and thus may depend on
a particular network's latency, bandwidth, etc.)
